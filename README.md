# Play Framework Url Shortener

This is a toy project, nothing really awesome or cool but it works.
It shorts the URL, and count the number of hits on it. There is a little administration interface.

This little web app use Play Framework (Scala) 2.3.x, Anorm & Twirl.
You have to change the database connexion URL in conf if you want to try it.
The login/password is also being set in conf, default to admin:admin.
